# COVID19  SQL  PROJECT - DATA EXPLORATION
I converted the .csv file into excel, prepared the dataset and imported the dataset into SQL Server.

Throughout this project, I leveraged SQL Server Management Studio to delve into and analyze the global COVID-19 dataset. My focus spanned queries centered on worldwide COVID data, specific insights within Africa's COVID landscape, and a deep dive into Nigeria's COVID statistics. Among the queries, I formulated several highlighted crucial metrics such as infection rate, death rate, and vaccination rate. I also calculated the likelihood of death post-infection as a percentage, gauged the percentage of the population infected, and assessed the percentage of the population vaccinated.
