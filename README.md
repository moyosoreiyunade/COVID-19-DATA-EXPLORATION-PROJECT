# COVID-19  SQL  PROJECT - DATA EXPLORATION

Throughout this project, I leveraged SQL Server Management Studio to delve into and analyze the global COVID-19 dataset, after having the .csv file converted into excel and the dataset prepared and imported into SQL Server. My focus spanned queries centered on worldwide COVID data, specific insights within Africa's COVID landscape, and a deep dive into Nigeria's COVID statistics. Among the queries, I formulated several highlighted crucial metrics such as infection rate, death rate, and vaccination rate. I also calculated the likelihood of death post-infection as a percentage, gauged the percentage of the population infected, and assessed the percentage of the population vaccinated.
